## Simulation Description (Under construction)
This sample simulation contains a simple ship dynamic model and two controllers. These three models are built with MATLAB Simulink on a Ubuntu 20.04 machine, and are exported to FMUs.

# 1. Model description
The simulation has three models: ship dynamics, thrust controller, and rudder controller.
The ship dynamics is described as below:
